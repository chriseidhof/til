# Wasm 

There are multiple patterns for wasm: reactor, command and library. [This blog post](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/webassembly-patterns-command-reactor-library) seems interesting. I learned this by watching Steven's talk on SwiftWasm, which has [code here](https://github.com/pwsacademy/swiftwasm-examples).
