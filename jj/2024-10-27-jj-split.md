## JJ Split

I looked a bit into [jj](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/latest/) during off hours. It's turned out to be really helpful for a couple of common workflows I have where I need to rewrite history.

Here's a sample log:

```
Development ) mkdir jj-split-example
Development ) cd jj-split-example/
jj-split-example ) jj git init
Initialized repo in "."
jj-split-example ) vim one.md
jj-split-example ) jj commit -m "First file"
Working copy now at: mqmurtut d2f2f217 (empty) (no description set)
Parent commit      : pxksptut affae1d5 First file
jj-split-example ) echo "hi" > two.md
jj-split-example ) jj describe -m "Second file"
Working copy now at: mqmurtut 04322f11 Second file
Parent commit      : pxksptut affae1d5 First file
jj-split-example ) jj log

jj-split-example ) jj split -i -r p

```

I wanted to split up my first commit (`p`) into two separate commits. I ran `jj split`. Because I have installed [diffedit3](https://github.com/ilyagr/diffedit3) and configured it to be my default diff editor (`jj config set ui.diff-editor "diffedit3"`) it brings up the browser, lets me remove all the lines that should be in the second commit and then I have everything the way I want it to be.
