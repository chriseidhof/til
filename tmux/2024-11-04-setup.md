# tmux Setup

I used to use screen but looked into a more modern alternative and found tmux.

Here are some useful commands:

- Ctrl+b " lets me add a split window
- Ctrl+b (up/down arrow) moves between splits
- Ctrl+b : goes into command mode. Usinge the resize-pane command I can make the split smaller or larger. I used `resize-pane -D 5` to make it 5 lines less tall (D is for downwards).
